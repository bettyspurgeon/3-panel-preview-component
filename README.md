## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used the challenge to further my understanding of basic flexbox principles and simple CSS animation/hover state. I was able to clairfy some things that had stumped be for a while and I quite like how it turned out though it's not pixel perfect to the challenge design. 
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I'm going to keep working with flexbox to solidify my understanding. 

### Useful resources

- The previous code along from Colt Steele's udemy course was helpful for this challenge.
